                        This project is about creating a computer program that
                        can "guess" the next note in a melody, a bit like how
                        some programs can predict the next word when you type on
                        your phone. But instead of working with words, this
                        program works with musical notes, using machine learning
                        to learn patterns from existing music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea is to help musicians in two ways. First, by
                        automatically suggesting the next note or measure when
                        they are composing, giving them ideas when they are
                        stuck or lacking inspiration; and second, by analyzing
                        existing sheet music to see which parts are predictable
                        or surprising, which can help understand what makes
                        music enjoyable to listen to. This program can therefore
                        be both an assistant for creating music and a tool for
                        understanding how music works. A first version of this
                        project is available

                        <i>Did you know? </i>The name SchuBERT is a clever play
                        on words combining the famous Austrian composer Schubert
                        and BERT, one of the earliest machine learning models
                        designed to process text. Paradoxically, SchuBERT
                        doesn't actually use a BERT-like architecture. It relies
                        on a more modern structure known as Transformers. Still,
                        the pun was just too good for the author to resist
                        keeping!

                        To teach our computer program to understand and create
                        music using machine learning, we need lots of example
                        songs. For this, we use a huge free collection of sheet
                        music called the PDMX database, which has over 250 000
                        pieces of music from the MuseScore platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a selected part of all these pieces, we convert
                        each musical note, rhythm, and rest from these digital
                        sheet music files, called .mxl files, into a sequence of
                        "tokens," which are like words in a text but for music.
                        This way, the computer can read and learn the patterns
                        in the music, just like it would learn patterns in
                        sentences when processing language. By turning the music
                        into tokens, we can then train our machine learning
                        model to predict the next note in a melody, helping it
                        both to analyze existing music and to generate new,
                        creative musical ideas.

                        Once we have our music transformed into sequences of
                        tokens, the next step is to teach our computer program
                        how to predict the next note using machine learning. To
                        do this, we train the model on thousands of these
                        sequences, showing it patterns and relationships between
                        notes, just like teaching a student by giving many
                        examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The model uses a type of advanced AI called
                        Transformers, which is very good at learning patterns
                        over long sequences, such as a melody in a song. During
                        training, the model tries to guess the next note for
                        each part of the music and adjusts itself when it makes
                        mistakes, gradually getting better and better. After the
                        model has learned enough, we can use it to generate new
                        music: given a few starting notes, it can suggest the
                        next notes one by one, creating new melodies that sound
                        coherent and musical. We can also test the model by
                        comparing its predictions to real music and by listening
                        to the melodies it generates, to make sure it is not
                        just repeating the same note over and over, but actually
                        creating interesting and harmonious sequences.
